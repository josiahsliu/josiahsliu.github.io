This project was a part of my scholarship "Harriet Bouslog Scholarship". The scholarship is part of ILWU which is the union that's worldwide. I was a part of this scholarship because I have many family relatives that are a part of the ILWU that works as a stevedore. I was able to hand out food drive's to family's and friends who was a part of the ILWU or who had family that was a part of the ILWU. It was a very fun time to help family's handing out food during a rough time when there was a pandemic and it was hard for them. During the pandemic many store's was close which was hard for family's to have food to provide for them. Having the food drive was a great thing to help support family's and to bond with people who had the same scholarship as me.
