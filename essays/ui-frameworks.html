<h1 id="ui-frameworks">UI Frameworks</h1>

<p>Bootstrap 5 is probably one of the most useful frameworks in HTML but sometimes it can be frustrating. Using Bootstrap 5 is definitely a go to when making websites to make it look appealing and attractive which kind of reminds that Bootstrap 5 is like a . It takes a lot of time and thought into the process for your code but it’s a great way to save time from using CSS and not stressing over CSS and HTML. Bootstrap 5 can give you many ideas which can give you “icons”, changing color on menus, easier to have images in the center and so much more. One thing about using Bootstrap 5 is that it’s really frustrating to get better at.</p>

<h1 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h1>

<p>There’s no problem using raw HTML and CSS, but it’s better to use the Bootstrap 5 framework to save you a lot of time and to have your website looking clean with “app icons”, “style buttons” and much more. The downside of doing HTML and CSS raw is that you’re gonna have to depend on CSS a lot more with changing the image of its radius, position, height, width, center or not center and it’s just a huge process. You’re most likely going to have to worry about two things at the same time when you can worry about HTML mainly with using Bootstrap 5. It does have its ups and downs with the timing but the important thing is that you need to be patient when using Bootstrap 5 because it can be frustrating and it’s not easy. I do believe that software engineering benefits UI frameworks because it can help us instead of just using raw HTML and CSS.</p>

<h1 id="challenge-yourself">Challenge Yourself</h1>

<p>From using Bootstrap 5 framework does have its pros and cons but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use Bootstrap 5. Its framework is really hard to get down and to understand but once you’re able to learn it can be extremely helpful and fun. It may be frustrating and takes a lot of time, but it’s a great framework to use for HTML, and it can save a lot of time using CSS.</p>
