Taking this class it was a great experience and made me realize there is much more than just coding. I've most definitely learned a lot from this class and this course challenged me mentally and made me realized that we can use the stuff that we've learned and use it for our future. A lot of things helped me get through this course from the help of Coding Standards and UI Frameworks.

Next time, when using design patterns I need to relax and see where my code is headed and make sure that it's a lot clean.
