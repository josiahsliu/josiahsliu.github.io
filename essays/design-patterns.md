# My perspective on Design Patterns ! 

Design Patterns are basically a way of making code very neat and fixing them with the appropriate purpose. The way I see it, it can be very useful. It will only be able to fix with a certain type of problem instead of dealing with all types of problems. It can be very neat by having it organized by making your code look very attractive in a way. Although Design Patterns can have better alternative from fixing your problems, it can be a bit frustrating. 

# Design Patters Useful or Not ?

Design patterns can be very useful which I've used in my own code was with my final projects. A lot of times ESLint will help me out but there would be a lot of bugs in different files. At first when I first started working on the final project it was hard to get through different approaches which I tried to put a card with some type of text and it took me awhile to make sure it was set because there was a lot of bugs that I've tried to fix in my code but eventually later on with my final project, it was much easier to fix certain bugs and able to get through each process smoothly. It can be frustrating at first but it becomes very useful later on in the process. 

# Conclusion

After talking about ESLint, I need to realize that using ESLint isn’t trying to scare but it’s trying to help me to be a lot more organized. Even though it's very tedious, it can also help me improve my coding skills by making it more efficient and readable. ESLint can help me in the future which I’m excited about.
