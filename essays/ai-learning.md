# Introduction

When it comes to the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence), many people think that it's cheating or a way of being lazy to do it on your own. Before I came into ICS 314, I've never used AI and I regretted not being able to use AI. I love using AI because it always gives me an idea or a different approach that I can take. Using AI in ICS 314 made me realized that any type of AI can help us learn and have an idea for our problem solving but sometimes AI can be wrong and not always right. I've used ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot whixh they've been very useful for me. 

# Personal Experience with AI

* Experience WODS : For Experience WODS I've never used AI for these type of assignments because it was always to do your best and see if you can do it on your own. Using AI was never really needed for these type of things because they would provide videos on what to do and to see if you can do better. 

* In-class Practice WODs : For in-class Practice WODs, I didn't really use AI just because you had a lot of time to figure out on how you're able to figure it out and also, you had a partner that you can talk too if you're stuck. I would always try to use the skills that I know to try and solve the problem. 

* In-class WODs: For in-class WODs, I would use some AI depending on the problem. I admit that I did use Chat GPT and GitHub Co-Pilot which was very useful. Some of the WOD's were straightforward and didn't really need the use of AI but they can be helpful even though you already know how to solve the WODs. Some examples were Javascript that I would use AI sometimes but for HTML and CSS, it seemed straightforward and didn't use AI. 

* Essays : When it comes to Essays, I've never used AI at all for essays. Essays are meant to share the world your expereiences and knowledge about a topic to talk about or "this" for example. I've never understand the use of AI for essays but personally for me, I've never had to use AI.

* Final project : For this final project, I'm currently using AI which is ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot. They're very useful because a lot of times I get very confused and a lot of times I do have to search up stuff like different icons for example. AI is not meant to give you answers all the time because they can be wrong but it gives me ideas. 

* Learning a concept / tutorial : A lot of tutorials and learning a concept that we did for this class didn't make me use AI. The tutortials and the learning gave me an understanding like the "FreeCodeCamp" that was provided for us. Using AI wasn't necessary for tutorials. 

* Answering a question in class or in Discord : I've never used AI to answer a question in class or in Discord. If I don't have the answer then I wouldn't say anything but if I was to know the answer then I would answer the following question. 

* Asking or answering a smart-question : I would sometimes use google or maybe ChatGPT to ask a question but usually I never really had to. I would say using AI to answer your questions is very useful. Personally for me I would want to ask google or ChatGPT a question then if I don't know the answer then I would ask the class. 

* Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck” : For code examples I would use the internet on what it's used for and how 



# Challenge Yourself

From using Bootstrap 5 framework does have its pros and cons but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use Bootstrap 5. Its framework is really hard to get down and to understand but once you’re able to learn it can be extremely helpful and fun. It may be frustrating and takes a lot of time, but it’s a great framework to use for HTML, and it can save a lot of time using CSS.
