# Overview
The problem : There are many drinks in vending machines that are located all around UH Manoa campus which are Campus Center, Warrior Rec Center, near Zone 20, Shidler Building, Paradise Palms and much more other locations in UH Manoa. What if that one drink that you enjoy so much is not in that vending machine that you go to all the time and don't know which vending machines around campus has your favorite drink? Let's say you go to the next vending machine and it's out of order, then you have to go to the next and the next and the next, and realizing that you wasted so much time that every vending machine that you went to is all out of order. 

The solution : Create a database where students or professors can see which drinks is avaiable or out of order at which vending machine around UH Manoa.
