<h1 id="javascript">JavaScript</h1>

<p>JavaScript has to be the easiest and most enjoyable language that I’ve used so far in my experience. In ICS 111 and 211 at UH Manoa, I did learn Java which was a lot more challenging for me. In high school I learned a little of C++, and I learned a little bit of HTML. When learning JavaScript, it was a lot easier for me to understand the language and was quite easier for me to get familiar with. For Java and C++, it takes a lot of time and brainstorming for completion. I believe that it should be everyone’s first language to learn if they’re interested in Computer Science or Software Engineering. It shows that JavaScript is a much faster pace in solving problems than Java and C++.</p>

<p>I do believe that I was a lot slower using Java, but now that I’m learning JavaScript I’m a lot more confident in solving solutions. I’m able to solve solutions a lot faster in JavaScript then I can with Java.</p>

<h1 id="practice-wod">Practice WOD</h1>

<p>The practice WOD’s are very useful and it is always good for practice. It is a lot of pressure which feels like you’re running out of time and trying so hard to not get “DNF”. This class is very fast paced which I expected but it allows me to focus a lot more. I’ve always challenged myself and attending the WOD’s practice helps me prepare for myself in the future on game day. I would admit, it is very stressful when it’s game day but if you practice every time on the WOD’s you will be just fine. It’s very enjoyable for me because it’s very satisfying solving the WOD’s, and even though I get it wrong I’m still able to learn from my mistakes and to practice again. The WOD’s do work for me very well and it helps to do better next time.</p>
