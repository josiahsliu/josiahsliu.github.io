# Inspiration 

Before I knew or started programming, my interest was always playing video games. Back then I used to play every video game console that you can think of which were Game Boy, GameCube, DS, WII, Nintendo 64, Atari, Xbox, Playstation, PC and many more. Every game that I played that I enjoyed I've always wondered to myself how is it possible to make such a good game that people love. That's when I took an interest in CS major and wanted to learn so much more about Software Engineering. 

I wanted to know what's the hype about Software Engineering and what it takes to learn the knowledge. I've always wanted to learn something new when I was little, when it was learning a new game, how to build a pc, learning on how to play a new gaming console, and even learning a new language. 


# The Class

In this class ICS 314 is most definetly one of the most stressful classes I've taken so far. I'm very excited and always up for the challenge in which I can apply the skills for this class in my future wherever I go. Taking this class is definetly helping me to improve my skills in coding and in life.
